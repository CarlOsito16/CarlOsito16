## Hi there ðŸ‘‹âœ¨

I am a career switcher with HR domains to Data Science and AI. 

After completing my first year in Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­, I received a scholarship and am doing a dual-degree Master program in Data Science in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
Starting from February 2023, I am so excited to be joining a startup as AI developer in Paris âœ¨


Despite my newly found interest and experience in this field, I am proud to have accomplished multiple projects related to data science as follows:
## Academic final projects
- [Employee Sentiment Classification](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/CPNEE-new)
- [Masked BERT Model on Depression Detection on Social Media](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/NLP_Depression_Detection_Project) ([presentation](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhaxmg38FmrME_lMQAI?e=fYXOwJ))
