## Hi there ðŸ‘‹âœ¨

I am a career switcher with HR domains to Data Science and AI. 

After completing my first year in Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­, I received a scholarship and am doing a dual-degree Master program in Data Science in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
Starting from February 2023, I am so excited to be joining a startup as AI developer in Paris âœ¨


Despite my newly found interest and experience in this field, I am proud to have accomplished multiple projects related to data science and AI as follows:
## Academic final projects

### Structured Data

- [HR Analytics: Insights behind Employees Productivity, Performance and Attrition]() ([presentation](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=5A38BE4A4C58386D&id=5A38BE4A4C58386D%219065&parId=5A38BE4A4C58386D%218984&o=OneUp)): Using the HR-related public dataset from Kaggle, my contribution to this group project is on the statistical test to identify the pay equity and salary increment among gender and department. I also developed and deployed the model to predict the attrition rate of employees.


- [Credit Card Customer Clustering](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/card-customer-segmentation) ([presentation](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Am04WExKvjhaibYLTk7qWDmqNmyXCg?e=Aupcgy)): In this unsupervised project, the main task is to cluster customers into segments so as to understand each segment's behavior and profile for the business to offer the right product. Principal component analysis is used for dimensionality reduction before putiing into the K-mean clustering. Outliers of each output cluster is removed by another unsupervised algorithm of DBSCAN. The resuling clusters are explained in tree diagram with business interpretation

### Non-Structured Data
- [Sentiment and Topic Classification on Textual Employee Engagement Survey](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/CPNEE-new) ([presentation](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhavQlXZBxHtatbRD14?e=3e2fmq), [paper](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhavQip1tHeYNvA50ue?e=lJ8oFM)): My ever first ML project using the employee engagement survey from a company I worked as HR. We tackled the classification problem by comparing between the using traditional NLP approach TF-IDF and the more recent of pre-trained BERT model to see their performance for 2-class sentiment classfication (Positive/ Negative) and 10-class topic classificaiton (Compensation, Work-Life Balance, Management, etc.)

- [Masked BERT Model on Depression Detection on Social Media](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/NLP_Depression_Detection_Project) ([presentation](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhaxmg38FmrME_lMQAI?e=fYXOwJ)): Inspired by the knowledge enhanced masking technique mentioned in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.376/), we retrain the BERT model on depression Twitter datasets by selectively masking the depression-related English vocabulary consulted from [Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count](https://www.liwc.app) to see if the finetuned model could perform better in the classsificaiton task
