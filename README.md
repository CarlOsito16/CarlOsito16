## Hi there ðŸ‘‹âœ¨

I am a career switcher from HR domains to Data Science and AI. 

After completing my first year in Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­, I received a scholarship and am doing a dual-degree Master program in Data Science in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
Starting from February 2023, I am so excited to be joining a startup as NLP engineer in Paris âœ¨


Despite my newly found interest and experience in this field, I am proud to have accomplished multiple projects related to data science and AI as listed alphabetically below:
## Academic projects

### Structured Data

- [Credit Card Customer Clustering](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/card-customer-segmentation) ([presentation](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Am04WExKvjhaibYLTk7qWDmqNmyXCg?e=Aupcgy)): In this unsupervised project, the main task is to cluster customers into segments so as to understand each segment's behavior and profile for the business to offer the right product. Principal component analysis is used for dimensionality reduction before putiing into the K-mean clustering. Outliers of each output cluster is removed by another unsupervised algorithm of DBSCAN. The resuling clusters are explained in tree diagram with business interpretation

- [Does reduced traffic flow result in better air quality?](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/IoTMadrid) ([presentation](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhaibZyWewjBUdJJiyymw?e=HbSISd), [paper](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhaibZzyvrpTpDqYqVCPw?e=1et3sC)): This project is for IoT class in which I am studying the correlation between the traffic flow and the air pollutant levels using the open dataset from Madrid, Spain. The analysis goes deeper in identifying the pattern and gauge the statistical signifiance in ternms of traffic change and its correlation before COVID, during COVID and after COVID years.

- [HR Analytics: Insights behind Employees Productivity, Performance and Attrition](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/BIA) ([presentation](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhaxmmzmoK2ybwwD65v?e=gaoKbR), [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Carlosito16/BIA_IBMAttrition)): Using the HR-related public dataset from Kaggle, my contribution to this group project is on the statistical test to identify the pay equity and salary increment among gender and department. I also developed and deployed the model to predict the attrition rate of employees.






### Non-Structured Data


- [5 Emotion Recognition with Deep Neural Network on Brain Signal Dataset (SEED-V)](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/CP_EEG) ([presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SXF2A1UCscwQ7MBZUSAdMieHb816HPJ9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100485254388899021611&rtpof=true&sd=true)): Using the electroencephalogram dataset from the BCMI brain lab, this project tried to compare the performance of 5-emotion classification with subject-independent and session-independent training. We used both traditional ML algorighms as well as a deep basic neural network to see their performance.


- [Masked BERT Model on Depression Detection on Social Media](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/NLP_Depression_Detection_Project) ([presentation](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhaxmg38FmrME_lMQAI?e=fYXOwJ)): Inspired by the knowledge enhanced masking technique mentioned in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.376/), we retrain the BERT model on depression Twitter datasets by selectively masking the depression-related English vocabulary consulted from [Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count](https://www.liwc.app) to see if the finetuned model could perform better in the classsificaiton task


- [Sentiment and Topic Classification on Textual Employee Engagement Survey](https://github.com/CarlOsito16/CPNEE-new) ([presentation](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhavQlXZBxHtatbRD14?e=3e2fmq), [paper](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Am04WExKvjhavQip1tHeYNvA50ue?e=lJ8oFM)): My ever first ML project using the employee engagement survey from a company I worked as HR. We tackled the classification problem by comparing between the using traditional NLP approach TF-IDF and the more recent of pre-trained BERT model to see their performance for 2-class sentiment classfication (Positive/ Negative) and 10-class topic classificaiton (Compensation, Work-Life Balance, Management, etc.)

- [Visual Word Sense Disambiguation](https://github.com/akmyat/V-WSD/tree/main/poon-method) ([presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFTJb80n7c/5jyx6JcOmZiVOSfW6_1zKg/view?utm_content=DAFTJb80n7c&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton), [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Carlosito16/DL-Image-text-disambiguity)): Joining the participation of [17th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation - Task 1](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2023/tasks.html), our group proposed different architectures and used diversed huge pretrained model including Visual transforme and Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained model (CLIP) to compute the closest similarity between ambiguous words (as in 'bank savings' and 'bank erosion' to the 10 different images. The goal is to have the model choose a correct image relevant to the given context.
