## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a career switcher with HR domains to Data Science and AI. 

After completing my first year in Thailand ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡­, I am currently joining dual-degree Master program in Data Science in France ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·, and will start my internship with a start-up company in Paris from February 2023.
